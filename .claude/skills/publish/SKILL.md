# VS Code Marketplace Publish Skill

Runs the full release sequence for vivid-life-vs-code: pre-flight → version
bump → CHANGELOG update → commit → tag → push. The actual `vsce publish`
runs in GitHub Actions after the tag lands.

## Pre-flight

Run all checks before doing anything else. Stop and report clearly if any fail.

- Verify on `main`: `git branch --show-current` must output `main`
- Verify working tree clean: `git status --porcelain` must produce no output
- Verify build passes: `npm run build` must exit without error

## CHANGELOG Check

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Locate the `## [Unreleased]` section.

If it contains no entries (only the heading and surrounding blank lines), stop:

> The `[Unreleased]` section in CHANGELOG.md is empty.
> Document what changed before running `/publish`.

Otherwise show the user the full contents of the `[Unreleased]` section and continue.

## Version Confirmation

Read `"version"` from `package.json` and show the current value.

Show the `[Unreleased]` contents again as context.

Ask the user to confirm the new version number. Suggest the appropriate bump:

- Patch (X.Y.Z+1): bug fixes, documentation updates
- Minor (X.Y+1.0): new themes, new variants, new features
- Major (X+1.0.0): breaking changes to the theme naming or structure

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding.

## Bump Version

Edit `package.json`: change `"version"` to the confirmed version string.

## Update CHANGELOG

Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. Replace the `## [Unreleased]` heading with `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   where `YYYY-MM-DD` is today's date in ISO 8601 format
2. Insert a new `## [Unreleased]` section at the top (before the versioned
   entry), with a blank line after the heading

The result should look like:

```
## [Unreleased]

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### <category>

- <entry>

```

## Commit

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "🔖 chore(release): bump to vX.Y.Z

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Tag

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
```

## Push

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

This fires the `publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. `vsce publish` runs
in CI using the `VSCE_PAT` secret — the PAT never touches the local machine.

## Confirm

Report to the user:

> Tag vX.Y.Z pushed. Monitor the publish run at:
> https://github.com/vivid-life-theme/vivid-life-vs-code/actions
>
> The Marketplace listing typically updates within a few minutes of the
> workflow completing. Verify at:
